# Unity3D
Unity 3d game project
The game does not behave as the tutorial shows. When the jump key is pressed, the player obly lifts a little way off the ground
then falls back. The behaviour is different on different low-spec laptops. On one the player never properly jumps. On another 
it sometimes jumps properly, at other times not.
